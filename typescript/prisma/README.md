# Aurora DSQL with Prisma

## Overview

This package provides tools for using Prisma ORM with Amazon Aurora DSQL:

1. **Schema Validator** - Validates Prisma schemas for DSQL compatibility
2. **Migration Transformer** - Converts Prisma migrations to DSQL-compatible SQL
3. **DSQL Prisma Client** - Prisma client with automatic IAM authentication

Aurora DSQL is a distributed SQL database service that provides high availability and scalability for your
PostgreSQL-compatible applications. Prisma is a modern database toolkit that provides type-safe database access,
automated migrations, and an intuitive data model for TypeScript and JavaScript applications.

## Quick Start

The fastest way to generate a DSQL-compatible migration:

```bash
# One command: validates schema, generates migration, transforms for DSQL
npm run dsql-migrate prisma/schema.prisma -o prisma/migrations/001_init/migration.sql
```

If validation fails, fix your schema and re-run. That's it!

For incremental migrations (after your initial deployment), see [Incremental Migrations](#incremental-migrations) below.

For more control, see the [manual workflow](#recommended-workflow) below.

## Project Structure

- **`src/`** - Sample code that you can copy into your own project
- **`helpers/`** - Optional tooling (schema validator, migration transformer) - useful during development but not required in your final project

## Recommended Workflow

For more control over each step, you can run the tools separately:

1. **Write your Prisma schema** - Define your models in `prisma/schema.prisma`

2. **Validate for DSQL compatibility** - Run the validator to catch issues early:

    ```bash
    npm run validate prisma/schema.prisma
    ```

3. **Generate Prisma client** - Generate the type-safe client:

    ```bash
    npx prisma generate
    ```

4. **Generate DSQL-compatible migrations** - Use Prisma's diff tool with the transformer:

    ```bash
    # Generate and transform in one step
    npx prisma migrate diff \
        --from-empty \
        --to-schema-datamodel prisma/schema.prisma \
        --script | npm run dsql-transform > prisma/migrations/001_init/migration.sql
    ```

5. **Apply migrations** - Deploy your schema:

    ```bash
    npm run prisma:migrate-up
    ```

6. **Use the DSQL Prisma Client** - Connect and query with automatic IAM auth

## Schema Validator

Validate your Prisma schema for DSQL compatibility before runtime:

```bash
npm run validate prisma/schema.prisma
```

### What the Validator Checks

Aurora DSQL has [specific PostgreSQL compatibility limitations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/working-with-postgresql-compatibility-unsupported-features.html). The validator catches Prisma schema patterns that will fail at runtime:

| Check                                  | Type    | DSQL Limitation                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------- |
| Missing `relationMode = "prisma"`      | Error   | Foreign keys not supported      |
| `autoincrement()`                      | Error   | Sequences not supported         |
| `@db.Serial`                           | Error   | Sequences not supported         |
| `@db.SmallSerial`                      | Error   | Sequences not supported         |
| `@db.BigSerial`                        | Error   | Sequences not supported         |
| `@@fulltext`                           | Error   | Full-text indexes not supported |
| `Int @id` without autoincrement        | Warning | Manual ID management needed     |
| `BigInt @id`                           | Warning | Typically requires sequences    |
| `gen_random_uuid()` without `@db.Uuid` | Warning | Should use proper UUID type     |

> **Note:** This table reflects DSQL limitations as of December 2025. Check the linked docs for the latest.

### Example Output

```
✗ autoincrement() is not supported in DSQL (line 12)
  → Use @default(dbgenerated("gen_random_uuid()")) @db.Uuid instead

✗ Missing relationMode = "prisma" in datasource block (line 3)
  → Add relationMode = "prisma" to your datasource block. DSQL does not support foreign key constraints.

✗ Validation failed: 2 error(s), 0 warning(s)
```

## Migration Transformer

Transform Prisma-generated migrations to be DSQL-compatible:

```bash
# Transform from file
npm run dsql-transform raw.sql -o migration.sql

# Transform using pipes (recommended)
npx prisma migrate diff \
    --from-empty \
    --to-schema-datamodel prisma/schema.prisma \
    --script | npm run dsql-transform > migration.sql
```

### What the Transformer Does

The transformer automatically applies DSQL-required changes to Prisma's migration output:

| Transformation                                  | Reason                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Wraps each statement in `BEGIN/COMMIT`          | DSQL requires one DDL statement per transaction                     |
| Converts `CREATE INDEX` to `CREATE INDEX ASYNC` | DSQL requires asynchronous index creation                           |
| Removes foreign key constraints                 | DSQL requires application-layer referential integrity (see warning) |

> **Note:** When foreign keys are removed, you'll see a warning reminding you to use `relationMode = "prisma"` in your schema. This tells Prisma to handle referential integrity in your application code rather than the database. See [Prisma's relation mode documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/relations/relation-mode) for details.

### Example

**Input (Prisma output):**

```sql
CREATE TABLE "user" (
    "id" UUID NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    "name" VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);

CREATE INDEX "user_name_idx" ON "user"("name");

ALTER TABLE "post" ADD CONSTRAINT "post_authorId_fkey"
    FOREIGN KEY ("authorId") REFERENCES "user"("id");
```

**Output (DSQL-compatible):**

```sql
BEGIN;
CREATE TABLE "user" (
    "id" UUID NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    "name" VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);
COMMIT;

BEGIN;
CREATE INDEX ASYNC "user_name_idx" ON "user"("name");
COMMIT;
```

Note: The foreign key constraint is automatically removed since DSQL doesn't support them.

## Incremental Migrations

After your initial deployment, when you need to make schema changes (add columns, tables, indexes), use the `--from-url` option to generate a migration that only includes the differences:

```bash
npm run dsql-migrate prisma/schema.prisma \
    -o prisma/migrations/002_add_email/migration.sql \
    --from-url "$DATABASE_URL"
```

This compares your updated schema against the live database and generates only the necessary changes.

### Migration Ordering

Migrations must be applied in order. Use numbered prefixes to ensure correct ordering:

```
prisma/migrations/
├── 001_init/
│   └── migration.sql
├── 002_add_email/
│   └── migration.sql
└── 003_add_index/
    └── migration.sql
```

If no changes are detected, the command will exit with a success message:

```
✓ No changes detected - schema is up to date
```

### Handling Unsupported Statements

Sometimes Prisma generates `DROP CONSTRAINT` statements when comparing against a live database (e.g., to recreate primary keys). DSQL doesn't support `DROP CONSTRAINT`, so the tool will fail by default:

```
✗ Migration contains unsupported DSQL statements:

  ALTER TABLE "vet" DROP CONSTRAINT "vet_pkey"

DSQL doesn't support ALTER TABLE DROP CONSTRAINT.
```

If the primary key isn't actually changing (Prisma is just being cautious), use `--force` to skip these statements:

```bash
npm run dsql-migrate prisma/schema.prisma \
    -o prisma/migrations/002_add_email/migration.sql \
    --from-url "$DATABASE_URL" \
    --force
```

> **Warning:** Only use `--force` if you're certain the constraint changes are safe to skip. If you're actually changing a primary key, you'll need to recreate the table instead.

## About the Example

The example uses the [Aurora DSQL Connector](https://github.com/awslabs/aurora-dsql-nodejs-connector) for automatic
IAM authentication and connection pooling. It demonstrates:

- Opening a connection to an Aurora DSQL cluster using Prisma
- Inserting and querying data using Prisma's type-safe client
- Managing relationships between entities (owners, pets, veterinarians, and specialties)

The example is designed to work with both admin and non-admin users:

- When run as an **admin user**, it uses the `public` schema
- When run as a **non-admin user**, it uses the `myschema` schema

The code automatically detects the user type and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

### Usage

```typescript
import { DsqlPrismaClient } from "./dsql-client";

const client = new DsqlPrismaClient();

// Use Prisma as normal
const users = await client.user.findMany();

// Clean up
await client.dispose();
```

## ⚠️ Important

- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.
- We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the
  minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see
  [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege).
- This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see
  [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

## Run the Example

### Prerequisites

- You must have an AWS account, and have your default credentials and AWS Region
  configured as described in the
  [Globally configuring AWS SDKs and tools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/creds-config-files.html)
  guide.
- [Node 20.0.0](https://nodejs.org) or later.
- You must have an Aurora DSQL cluster. For information about creating an Aurora DSQL cluster, see the
  [Getting started with Aurora DSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/getting-started.html)
  guide.
- If connecting as a non-admin user, ensure the user is linked to an IAM role and is granted access to the `myschema`
  schema. See the
  [Using database roles with IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/using-database-and-iam-roles.html)
  guide.

### Install dependencies

Install all required packages for the Prisma example:

```bash
npm install
```

### Set environment variables

Set environment variables for your cluster details:

```bash
# e.g. "admin"
export CLUSTER_USER="<your user>"

# e.g. "foo0bar1baz2quux3quuux4.dsql.us-east-1.on.aws"
export CLUSTER_ENDPOINT="<your endpoint>"
```

### Database migrations

Before running the example, you need to apply database migrations to create the required tables. Prisma's migration
tool requires a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable with authentication credentials.

Generate an authentication token following the instructions in
the [Aurora DSQL authentication token guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/SECTION_authentication-token.html)
and set it as the `CLUSTER_PASSWORD` environment variable, then set up the database URL:

```bash
# Set schema based on user type.
if [ "$CLUSTER_USER" = "admin" ]; then
  export SCHEMA="public"
else
  export SCHEMA="myschema"
fi

# URL-encode password for consumption by Prisma.
export ENCODED_PASSWORD=$(python -c "from urllib.parse import quote; print(quote('$CLUSTER_PASSWORD', safe=''))")

# Set up DATABASE_URL for Prisma migrations.
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://$CLUSTER_USER:$ENCODED_PASSWORD@$CLUSTER_ENDPOINT:5432/postgres?sslmode=verify-full&schema=$SCHEMA"
```

Apply the database migrations:

```bash
# Create the database schema
npm run prisma:migrate-up
```

To remove the database schema when you're done:

```bash
# Clean up the database schema
npm run prisma:migrate-down
```

### Run the example

**Note:** running the example will use actual resources in your AWS account and may incur charges.

```bash
npm run sample
```

### Run tests

The example includes integration tests that verify the Prisma client functionality with DSQL.

**Note:** running the tests will use actual resources in your AWS account and may incur charges.

```bash
npm test
```

## Prisma Considerations with Aurora DSQL

When using Prisma with Aurora DSQL, be aware of the following considerations and limitations.
For full details on DSQL limitations, see [Unsupported PostgreSQL features in Aurora DSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/working-with-postgresql-compatibility-unsupported-features.html).

### Configuration Requirements

- **Relation mode**: Set `relationMode = "prisma"` to handle referential integrity at the application level (DSQL does not support foreign keys).
- **Model IDs**: Use `gen_random_uuid()` to create DSQL-compatible automatic unique IDs (DSQL does not support sequences).

### Migration Requirements

- **Advisory Locks**: Disable Prisma's default advisory locks behavior by setting
  `PRISMA_SCHEMA_DISABLE_ADVISORY_LOCK=1`.
- **Use the transformer**: Run `npm run dsql-transform` on Prisma's migration output to automatically apply DSQL-required changes (transaction wrapping, async indexes, foreign key removal).
